    "In implementing Naive Bayes Algorithm (NBA) we calculate for each word its conditional probabilities $P(word|spam)$ and $P(word|ham)$. However for some strings in our messages, it may make more sense to group them together into a class. For example, as we saw above, a distinguishing feature of the messages is the prescence of phone numbers. Spam messages tend to have phone numbers of length 11 or 6, while ham messages don't. However, as one might expect, the phone number in each spam message is probably different. Hence, if we just run NBA with individual phone numbers, the phone numbers won't have much of an effect when we run our classifier on the test data since the spam messages in the test data probably have different phone numbers from the spam messages in the training data. Instead, it would be more effective to introduce a phone_num feature that equals the number of times a phone number appears in a message. Similarly, we will also introduce a money_num feature that equals the number of money values in a message.\n",

Moreover, most of these spam messages appear to have 5 or 11 digit phone numbers--which was a feature we accounted for in our model above. Perhaps we need to assign a larger weight to phone_nums feature. One thing we can try to improve the accuracy of our model is introduce a $\\beta$ parameter that gives a larger weight to phone_nums. So our new probability for $P(w_i|spam)$ would be:<font/>\n",

# Spam Filter
Implemented Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm to build filter to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The dataset used to train and test the classifier can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

The smsspamcollection folder contains the downloaded dataset as well as a readme created by the authors of the dataset.
